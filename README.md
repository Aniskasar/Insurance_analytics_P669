# Insurance_analytics_P669
As a Data Analyst intern at AI Variant, I analyzed five insurance-related files (Brokerage, Fees, Invoice, Meeting, Opportunity, Budget). Imported in Excel via Power Query, I developed KPIs, visualized insights in Power BI (with DAX) and Tableau, and calculated KPIs in MySQL. This project supports data-driven decisions in insurance analytics.
